The course registration tool is meant to serve as a way for university adminsitrators, faculty/professors and students to be able to perform their perspective rolls when the time comes to register for courses for the coming academic term. Since this Python-built project has a GUI, I'd rather show than tell, so please, scroll along with me to see the actions and accesses supported for each user type. 
1. Registration Page: logically, the first step all users must do is register for a profile, creating login credentials associated with all the required fields and then agreeing to the terms and conditions. I'll register an adminsitrator, Jon Snow, to demonstrate.

2. Administrator Home Page: Since I've just created an administrative user, they will be taken to the Adminsitrator Home Page, where they can either upload a course for all other users to view as part of the catalog, or view that existing catalog.

3. Upload Courses Page: Let's upload a course! The administrator must fill in all the required details, and if they make a mistake (like not filling in each field or accidentally choosing a course start time that is AFTER the end time), the system will alert them before the change is pushed to the catalog.

4. Course Catalog Page: Great! Now, we can see the course Jon's just added in the course catalog, which as we'll see, is also available to view (but not edit) for all other user types.

5. Login Page: Now, let's login as a student user, who I registered previously, to see their privileges and abilities. The system will give an error message and deny access if the username and password entered don't match the ones stored during that user's registration.

6. Student Home Page: Because Tyrion is registered a student, it directs us automatically to the student home page, where we can see all the actions a student might want to take. Let's add some courses to our schedule for this term.

7. Add Courses Page: Here, we can see that the course codes available to select for registration are pulled from the catalog. I'll add a few to Tyrion's schedule.

8. View My Schedule Page (Student): Now, when we go back to the student home page, and view Tyrion's schedule, it's updated to include the courses added! But wait, what if he decides he's not up to organic chemistry next semester...

9. Drop Courses Page: If a student wants to remove a course from their schedule, they would navigate to the Drop Courses Page, and the system loads into the dropdown box only course codes which were on their schedule previously.

10. View My Schedule Page (Again): Now, we can see that the dropped course has been removed from the user's schedule when they navigate back to view my schedule. Cool!

11. Edit Profile Page: The other access a user is granted is to edit the details of the profile they set up upon registration. When this page is launched, the user's data is loaded in from the database, and they are only given access to edit certain fields (password, email, department, phone number), while others (username, first name, last name, birthday) are static and cannot be changed, although the user can view them from this page. We can edit the information in the text boxes for changable fields and then hit "save changes" which updates that user's details in the database.

12. Professor Home Page: The last type of user is faculty/professors. When we log in under a pre-registered user of this type, we are directed right away to the professor home page, where we can see they are allowed to either view the public course catalog or view their own schedules.

13. View My Schedule Page (Professor): Here, the faculty member is able to see the courses which they are the instructor for, which has been decided by the administration.
